<h4><strong>1. The Evolution of the Internet and the Web</strong></h4>
<p>Before we dive deep, let&rsquo;s review the history of the Internet and the Web. These two terms are often used interchangeably, but they refer to different things.</p>
<p><strong>Activity 1.1: Watch the Video</strong><br>Watch the short video on the history of the Internet. Pay special attention to the differences between the <strong>Internet</strong> and the <strong>Web</strong>, as well as their origins.</p>

<iframe width="600" height="350" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cut3D2JkcrQ" title="Did the U.S. Government Invent the Internet? | History" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><strong>Reflection Question</strong>:<br>After watching the video, explain in your own words the difference between the Internet and the Web.</p>
<hr>

<h4><strong>2. The Need for Web Standards</strong></h4>
<p>As the Web grew rapidly, it became clear that a consistent set of guidelines was necessary to ensure that web pages worked seamlessly across different browsers and devices. These guidelines are known as <strong>web standards</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Activity 2.1: Read and Reflect</strong><br>Read the article and watch the video from W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/">Web Standards</a> (https://www.w3.org/standards/) Focus on how they contribute to <strong>accessibility</strong>, <strong>usability</strong>, and <strong>security</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Quiz 2.1: Web Standards</strong><br>Answer the following multiple-choice questions based on the reading:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Why are web standards important?<br>a) To make websites more visually appealing<br>b) To ensure websites work consistently across devices<br>c) To increase website traffic</li>
</ol>
<hr>


<h4><strong>3. Universal Design and Accessible Web Design</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</strong>, launched by the <strong>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</strong> in 1997, aims to improve the Web&rsquo;s accessibility for people with disabilities. Its mission is to make the Web accessible to all users by developing guidelines, standards, tools, and resources.</p>
<p>Key components of WAI include:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</strong>: Provides standards for creating accessible content, covering text alternatives, navigability, and adaptability for different devices.</li>
    <li><strong>Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)</strong>: Ensures authoring tools are accessible and help create accessible web content.</li>
    <li><strong>User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)</strong>: Focuses on making web browsers and media players accessible.</li>
    <li><strong>WAI-ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)</strong>: Enhances accessibility for dynamic content and web applications by adding roles and properties to HTML elements.</li>
    <li><strong>Educational Resources</strong>: WAI offers tutorials, best practices, and policy guides for developers and policymakers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Web accessibility provides numerous benefits, including inclusive access, legal compliance, better usability, and improved SEO. WAI&rsquo;s efforts ensure that the Web is universally accessible, supporting legal, functional, and inclusive web design worldwide.</p>

<h4><strong>4. Reliable Resources on the Web</strong></h4>
<p>Not all information on the Web is trustworthy. It&apos;s essential to evaluate sources for credibility, reliability, and authority.</p>
<p><strong>Activity 4.1: Resource Evaluation Exercise</strong><br>Read two articles on a similar topic&mdash;one from a <strong>.edu</strong> domain and the other from a <strong>.com</strong> domain. Compare the reliability of both based on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Authority of the source</li>
    <li>Use of citations</li>
    <li>Quality of writing and evidence</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quiz 4.1: Evaluating Sources</strong><br>Answer these true/false questions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>A website ending in <strong>.edu</strong> is more likely to provide reliable information than one ending in <strong>.com</strong>.</li>
    <li>It is unnecessary to cross-reference information from multiple sources.</li>
</ol>
<hr>


<h4><strong>5. Ethical Use of the Web</strong></h4>
<p>Many websites rely on user-generated content (UGC), such as reviews, comments, or shared media. Ethical management of UGC is important to ensure that contributors&rsquo; rights are respected and that the content remains respectful and safe for all users.</p>
<h4>Best Practices:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Moderate Content</strong>: Implement clear content guidelines and actively moderate user-generated content to prevent hate speech, harassment, or misinformation.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect User Ownership</strong>: Give credit to users for the content they post and allow them to delete or edit their contributions as needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Protect Minors</strong>: Websites that allow user-generated content must implement safeguards to protect vulnerable users, such as minors, from exploitation or harmful interactions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discussion 5.1: Ethical Choices</strong><br>In your own words, explain why ethical use of the Web is important. Share a situation where you had to make an ethical decision about using online resources (or how you would handle such a situation).</p>
<hr>


<h4><strong>6. Web Browsers and Web Servers</strong></h4>
<p>Web browsers and web servers are two fundamental components of how the Web functions. The <strong>web browser</strong> is what you use to view content, and the <strong>web server</strong> stores and delivers that content.</p>
<p><strong>Activity 6.1: Browser Exploration</strong><br>Open your preferred web browser and explore its settings. Check out the <strong>developer tools</strong> (you can access these by pressing <strong>F12</strong> or right-clicking on a webpage and selecting &quot;Inspect&quot;). Explore how you can view the <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>network activity</strong> of a page.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection Question</strong>:<br>What did you learn about your browser&rsquo;s developer tools? How can they help you as a web developer?</p>
<hr>


<h4><strong>7. Networking Protocols</strong></h4>
<p><strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</strong> is the foundation of data communication on the web. When you visit a website, your browser sends an HTTP request to a web server, which responds with the requested data (like a webpage). HTTP operates over TCP/IP to ensure data is transferred reliably.</p>
<p><strong>Email Protocols</strong> govern how emails are sent, received, and stored. Common protocols include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)</strong>: Used for sending emails from one server to another.</li>
    <li><strong>IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)</strong>: Allows you to access and manage your emails on a server, keeping them synchronized across devices.</li>
    <li><strong>POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)</strong>: Downloads emails from a server to your local device, often removing them from the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>These email protocols also work over <strong>TCP/IP</strong>, which is a suite of protocols that manage data transmission across the internet. <strong>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</strong> breaks data into packets, ensures they arrive in order, and requests retransmission if packets are lost. <strong>IP (Internet Protocol)</strong> assigns unique addresses to each device (IP addresses) and routes packets between them.</p>
<p>In summary, <strong>HTTP</strong> handles web page requests, email protocols manage email flow, and <strong>TCP/IP</strong> provides the fundamental communication layer for both, ensuring reliable and ordered data transfer across networks.</p>
<p><strong>DNS (Domain Name System)</strong> is like the phonebook of the internet. It translates human-readable domain names (like <em><a rel="noopener" target="_new">www.example.com</a></em>) into IP addresses (like <em>192.0.2.1</em>) that computers use to identify each other on the network.</p>
<p>When you type a website address into your browser, a DNS query is sent to a DNS server. This server looks up the corresponding IP address for that domain name. If the server doesn&rsquo;t know the IP, it queries other DNS servers until it finds the correct one, allowing your browser to connect to the right web server.</p>
<p>DNS is essential for making the internet user-friendly, as it replaces the need to remember complex numerical IP addresses.</p>
<p><strong>Quiz 7.1: Networking Protocols</strong><br>Answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>What does the <strong>DNS</strong> protocol do?</li>
    <li>Which protocol is primarily used to view websites?</li>
</ol>
<hr>


<h4><strong>8. URIs and URLs</strong></h4>
<p>A <strong>URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)</strong> is a string of characters used to identify a resource on the internet or within a network. It provides a way to locate or reference a resource, such as a web page, an image, or a file, using a consistent format.</p>
<p>A URI typically consists of two main parts:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Scheme</strong>: Specifies the protocol or method used to access the resource (e.g., <em>http</em>, <em>ftp</em>, <em>mailto</em>).</li>
    <li><strong>Path</strong>: Defines the location of the resource on the server or within the system (e.g., <em>/images/logo.png</em>).</li>
</ol>
<p>A <strong>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</strong> is a type of URI that provides both the identifier and the means to locate the resource (e.g., <em><a rel="noopener" target="_new">https://www.example.com/page</a></em>). All URLs are URIs, but not all URIs are URLs.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>URI</strong>: <em>ftp://example.com/file.txt</em> (an FTP resource)</li>
    <li><strong>URL</strong>: <em><a rel="noopener" target="_new">https://www.example.com/index.html</a></em> (a web page)</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, a URI uniquely identifies a resource, while a URL specifies its location and how to access it.</p>
<hr>


<h4><strong>9. HTML</strong></h4>
<p>Watch the following video about HTML and how it works.</p>

<iframe width="600" height="350" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xKuJrmlCdig" title="What is HTML?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p><strong>HTML</strong>&nbsp;(HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. Below is a simple example of HTML.</p>
<p><strong>HTML Code Example</strong></p>
<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph of text on my first web page!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>&lt;html&gt;</strong>: The root element of the page.</li>
<li><strong>&lt;body&gt;</strong>: Contains the visible content of the page.</li>
<li><strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong>: Defines a paragraph of text.</li>
</ul>

<p>Try running this code! Copy the HTML Ccde example above into the text box below, then click on run.</p>

    <!-- Textarea for the user to input HTML -->
    <textarea id="htmlCode" placeholder="Write your HTML here..."></textarea>
    
    <!-- Run code button -->
    <button onclick="runCode()">Run Code</button>
    
    <!-- Output iframe where the HTML is rendered -->
    <iframe id="output" src="about:blank"></iframe>
<hr>
