    <strong>Introduction:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Welcome to the first chapter of your  web development journey! In this
    lesson, you will explore the foundational  concepts of the Internet and the
    World Wide Web. We will cover the history of  the Internet, how websites
    function, and how different components like  browsers, servers, and
    protocols work together to deliver web content.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson Content:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1. What is the Internet?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Internet is a vast network of  computers connected worldwide that
    communicate with each other. It enables data  exchange, communication, and
    access to information on a global scale.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Key Milestones in the History of the  Internet:</strong>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        <strong>1960s:</strong> The first ideas for the Internet       began
        with the development of ARPANET, a research project funded by the
        U.S. government.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>1970s:</strong> Email was invented, and the       first
        protocols for data exchange were established (like TCP/IP).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>1990s:</strong> The Internet became accessible       to the
        public, and the World Wide Web (WWW) was created, revolutionizing
        how information was shared.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>2000s-present:</strong> The rise of social media, mobile
        access, and high-speed broadband further expanded the Internet’s reach.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Key Components of the Internet:</strong>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        <strong>Servers:</strong> Computers that store data and       serve it
        to other computers (clients) over the Internet.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Browsers:</strong> Software programs that allow       users to
        access websites and view content. Examples: Google Chrome,
        Firefox, Safari.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Routers and Networks:</strong> Hardware and infrastructure that
        direct data between servers and clients.
    </li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>
    <strong>2. The World Wide Web: A Layer Above the Internet</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The World Wide Web (WWW) is a service  that operates on the Internet,
    providing access to websites and web content.  While the Internet is the
    infrastructure, the Web is a system of interlinked  documents accessed via
    browsers.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Key Concepts:</strong>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        <strong>Web Protocols (HTTP/HTTPS):</strong>
    </li>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>
            <strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer        Protocol)</strong> is a
            protocol for transferring data across the web.        It tells
            browsers how to request and receive web content.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer        Protocol Secure)</strong>
            is the secure version of HTTP, encrypting data to        protect
            privacy during transmission.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Websites, Webpages, and Domains:</strong>
    </li>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>
            <strong>Website:</strong> A collection of interconnected        web
            pages.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Webpage:</strong> A single document within a        website,
            typically a HTML file.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Domain Name:</strong> A human-readable address used
            to access websites (e.g., www.example.com).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Browsers and Their Role in       Rendering Web Content:</strong>
    </li>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>
            <strong>Browsers</strong> interpret HTML, CSS, and        JavaScript
            code to display websites to users. They retrieve files from
            servers and render them visually on your screen.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

</div>
<p>
    <strong>3. How Websites Work</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A website involves multiple steps and  systems to make sure you can view a
    page on your device. Let's break down the  process:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        <strong>Client-Server Model:</strong>
    </li>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>
            The <strong>client</strong> is your device        (e.g., a computer
            or smartphone). The <strong>server</strong> is where the
            website's data is stored. When you request a webpage, your browser
            (the        client) asks the server for the page.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Request-Response Cycle:</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
    <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li>
            <strong>Request:</strong> When you type a URL into the browser, the
            browser        sends a request to the server hosting the website.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Response:</strong> The server receives the request,
            processes it, and        sends back the requested data (webpage,
            images, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Render:</strong> The browser interprets the received data
            and renders        the content visually on your screen.
        </li>
    </ol>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        <strong>URLs and Domain Names:</strong>
    </li>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>
            <strong>URL (Uniform Resource Locator):</strong> The web address you
            type into        the browser's address bar. For example,
            https://www.example.com.
        </li>
        <li>
            A <strong>Domain Name</strong> is part of        the URL, and it
            represents the website’s address in a human-readable        form.
            Behind the scenes, the domain name is translated into an IP address
            that servers use to communicate.
        </li>
    </ul>

<p>
    <strong>2. URL Dissection Exercise:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Objective:</strong> To identify the parts of a URL and  understand
    how browsers use it to retrieve information.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Instructions:</strong> <br/>
    Below are three URLs. Break them down into their components (protocol,
    domain,  path, etc.):
</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>
        https://www.google.com/search?q=web+development
    </li>
    <li>
        http://www.example.org/contact.html
    </li>
    <li>
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>Task:</strong>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        Identify the <strong>protocol</strong> (HTTP/HTTPS).
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify the <strong>domain name</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify the <strong>path</strong> (the       specific page or resource
        on the server).
    </li>
    <li>
        Write down how the URL is       structured.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion:</strong> <br/>
    After completing the task, review your findings with the class. Discuss the
    function of each part of the URL and how the browser uses them to find and
    display a webpage.

<p>
    <strong>3. Client-Server Model Simulation:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Objective:</strong> To visualize how the client-server  model works
    in real life.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Instructions:</strong>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        Pair up with a classmate. One of       you will act as the
        <strong>
            client
        </strong>
        (the person requesting the web page) and       the other as the <strong>
        server</strong> (the one delivering the webpage).
    </li>
    <li>
        The client will ask for a page       (e.g., “Please give me the homepage
        of www.example.com”), and the server       will respond by "sending"
        back the page (you can print out a       page on paper or simply
        describe what happens).
    </li>
    <li>
        Switch roles after a few rounds.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Reflection:</strong> <br/>
    After the exercise, discuss the roles of the client and server in this
    interaction. Talk about how each step (request, response) mirrors what
    happens  when you access a website.
